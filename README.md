# ‚öΩ Football Match Predictor

This project uses **machine learning** to predict football match outcomes based on historical data and team statistics.  
The model is built with **scikit-learn‚Äôs Random Forest Classifier**, chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and capture complex feature interactions between teams.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Cleans and structures match data for training and evaluation.  
- **Model training**: Uses a **Random Forest** to classify match results as **Win** or **Loss**.  
- **Evaluation metrics**: Measures performance using precision, recall, and accuracy.  
- **Custom mapping**: Simplifies team names for consistent data processing.  
- **Expandable design**: Built to easily integrate additional models and datasets.

## üß† How It Works

1. Load match data and relevant predictors (team performance stats, venues, dates, etc.)  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing portions.  
3. Train the **RandomForestClassifier** to learn patterns in historical results.  
4. Evaluate the model and generate predictions for upcoming fixtures.  
5. Display results in a clean, interpretable format.

## üìà Future Improvements

To further improve prediction accuracy:
- **Add more data sources** (e.g., player stats, injuries, weather, betting odds)  
- **Start predicting draws** in addition to wins and losses for more realistic outcomes  
- **Experiment with advanced models** like XGBoost, LightGBM, or neural networks  
- **Tune hyperparameters** for optimal Random Forest performance  
- **Include new variables** such as home advantage, form trends, or team momentum  
- **Implement cross-validation** for more robust evaluation
